Dax is a rogue. His height is 5'11" and his weight is 175 lbs.      Dax is very lanky.      He has violet hair in long dreadlocks.      His face is shaped something like a homeplate. It is narrow, begins to taper at cheekbones, and comes to point at the chin.      His medium-length goatee is localized to the chin. His sideburns go down to his jawline.      Jax has large, wide, seafoam green eyes, and a sarcastic, slightly calculating gaze. One eyebrow is slightly raised at all times being ever vigilant, yet searching for humor in all circumstances.      His long, bony, but muscular hands are extremely dexterous, but capable of unequaled grace and strength. His skinny fingers allow access into tiny places, such as pockets and traps.     He wears midnight blackish-blue robes, resembling that of ancient far-east martial artists, but with a more modern feel. They are full of hidden pockets.      His utility belt around his waist contains many pockets, pouches, and loops for all the various tools and equipment he carries, but mostl are hidden beneath his cloak, however.      His grayish cloak, shifts slightly in color to blend in with the surroundings. It is tattered purposely for purely aesthetic reasons. His cloak flows perpetually about his body, helping to conceal his true form, and any equipment he carries.
