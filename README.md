## Character Description Interpreter

**Discontinued. Archived. I'll will be using AI for this process in the future.**

**Goal:**
To create a text parser based off of NPM Compromise that parses text descriptions of RPG characters and interprets that information to calculate character stats that are normally associated with an RPG character sheet.
